Ignorance of the law does not afford any excuse for any act or omission which would otherwise constitute an offence unless knowledge of the law by the offender is expressly declared to be an element of the offence. 7. Claim of right. A person is not criminally responsible in respect of an offence relating to property if the act done or omitted to be done by the person with respect to the property was done in the exercise of an honest claim of right and without intention to defraud. 8. Intention and motive. (1) Subject to the express provisions of this Code relating to negligent acts and omissions, a person is not criminally responsible for an act or omission which occurs independently of the exercise of his or her will or for an event which occurs by accident. (2) Unless the intention to cause a particular result is expressly declared to be an element of the offence constituted, in whole or in part, by an act or omission, the result intended to be caused by an act or omission is immaterial. (3) Unless otherwise expressly declared, the motive by which a person is induced to do or omit to do an act, or to form an intention, is immaterial so far as regards criminal responsibility. 9. Mistake of fact. (1) A person who does or omits to do an act under an honest and reasonable, but mistaken, belief in the existence of any state of things is not criminally responsible for the act or omission to any greater extent than if the real state of things had been such as he or she believed to exist. (2) The operation of this section may be excluded by the express or implied provisions of the law relating to the subject. 10. Presumption of sanity. Every person is presumed to be of sound mind, and to have been of sound mind at any time which comes in question, until the contrary is proved. 11. Insanity. A person is not criminally responsible for an act or omission if at the time of doing the act or making the omission he or she is through any disease affecting his or her mind incapable of understanding what he or she is doing or of knowing that he or she ought not to do the act or make the omission; but a person may be criminally responsible for an act or omission, although his or her mind is affected by disease, if that disease does not in fact produce upon his or her mind one or other of the effects mentioned in this section in reference to that act or omission. 12. Intoxication. (1) Except as provided in this section, intoxication shall not constitute a defence to any criminal charge. (2) Intoxication shall be a defence to any criminal charge if by reason of the intoxication the person charged at the time of the act or omission complained of did not know that the act or omission was wrong or did not know what he or she was doing and— (a) the state of intoxication was caused without his or her consent by the malicious or negligent act of another person; or (b) the person charged was by reason of intoxication insane, temporarily or otherwise, at the time of such act or omission. (3) Where the defence under subsection (2) is established, then in a case falling under subsection (2)(a) the accused person shall be discharged; and in a case falling under subsection (2)(b), the provisions of the Magistrates Court Act relating to insanity shall apply. (4) Intoxication shall be taken into account for the purpose of determining whether the person charged had formed any intention, specific or otherwise, in the absence of which he or she would not be guilty of the offence. (5) For the purposes of this section, “intoxication” shall be deemed to include a state produced by narcotics or drugs. 13. Judicial officers. Except as expressly provided by this Code, a judicial officer is not criminally responsible for anything done or omitted to be done by him or her in the exercise of his or her judicial functions, although the act done is in excess of his or her judicial authority or although he or she is bound to do the act omitted to be done. 14. Compulsion. A person is not criminally responsible for an offence if it is committed by two or more offenders and if the act is done or omitted only because during the whole of the time in which it is being done or omitted the person is compelled to do or omit to do the act by threats on the part of the other offender or offenders instantly to kill him or her or do him or her grievous bodily harm if he or she refuses; but threats of future injury do not excuse any offence. 15. Defence of person or property and rash, reckless and negligent acts. Subject to any express provisions in this Code or any other law in force in Uganda, criminal responsibility— (a) for the use of force in the defence of person and property; and (b) in respect of rash, reckless or negligent acts, shall be determined according to the principles of English law. 16. Use of force in effecting arrest. Where any person is charged with a criminal offence arising out of the arrest, or attempted arrest, by him or her of a person who forcibly resists the arrest or attempts to evade being arrested, the court shall, in considering whether the means used were necessary, or the degree of force used was reasonable, for the apprehension of that person, have regard to the gravity of the offence which had been or was being committed by the person and the circumstances in which the offence had been or was being committed by the person. 17. Compulsion by husband. A married woman is not free from criminal responsibility for doing or omitting to do an act merely because the act or omission takes place in the presence of her husband; but on a charge against a wife for any offence other than treason or murder, it shall be a good defence to prove that the offence was committed in the presence of, and under the coercion of, the husband. 18. Person not to be punished twice for same offence. A person shall not be punished twice either under this Code or under any other law for the same offence.Chapter2Chapter4",

Any person who, by print, writing, painting, effigy or by any means otherwise than solely by gestures, spoken words or other sounds, unlawfully publishes any defamatory matter concerning another person, with intent to defame that other person, commits the misdemeanour termed libel. 180. Definition of defamatory matter. (1) Defamatory matter is matter likely to injure the reputation of any person by exposing that person to hatred, contempt or ridicule, or likely to damage any person in his or her profession or trade by an injury to his or her reputation. (2) It is immaterial whether at the time of the publication of the defamatory matter the person concerning whom such matter is published is living or dead. (3) No prosecution for the publication of defamatory matter concerning a dead person shall be instituted without the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. 181. Definition of publication. (1) A person publishes a libel if he causes the print, writing, painting, effigy or other means by which the defamatory matter is conveyed to be so dealt with, either by exhibition, reading, recitation, description, delivery or otherwise, that the defamatory meaning thereof becomes known or is likely to become known to either the person defamed or any other person. (2) It is not necessary for libel that a defamatory meaning should be directly or completely expressed, and it suffices if such meaning and its application to the person alleged to be defamed can be collected either from the alleged libel itself or from any extrinsic circumstances or partly by the one and partly by the other means. 182. Definition of unlawful publication. Any publication of defamatory matter concerning a person is unlawful within the meaning of this Chapter, unless— (a) the matter is true and it was for the public benefit that it should be published; or (b) it is privileged on one of the grounds mentioned in this Chapter. 183. Absolute privilege of defamatory matter. (1) The publication of defamatory matter is absolutely privileged, and no person shall in any circumstances be liable to punishment under this Code in respect of such publication, in any of the following cases— (a) if the matter is published by the President, the Government or Parliament; (b) if the matter is published in Parliament by the Government or by any member of that Parliament or by the Speaker; (c) if the matter is published by order of the President or the Government; (d) if the matter is published concerning a person subject to military, naval or air force discipline for the time being, and relates to his or her conduct as a person subject to such discipline, and is published by some person having authority over him or her in respect of such conduct, and to some person having authority over him or her in respect of such conduct; (e) if the matter is published in the course of any judicial proceedings by a person taking part in them as a judge, magistrate, commissioner, advocate, assessor, juror, witness or party to the proceedings; (f) if the matter published is in fact a fair report of anything said, done or published in Parliament; or (g) if the person publishing the matter is legally bound to publish it. (2) Where a publication is absolutely privileged, it is immaterial for the purposes of this Chapter whether the matter is true or false, and whether it is or is not known or believed to be false and whether it is or is not published in good faith; but nothing in this section shall exempt a person from any liability to punishment under any other Chapter of this Code or under any other written law in force in Uganda. 184. Conditional privilege of defamatory matter. The publication of defamatory matter is privileged if it is published in good faith and— (a) if the relation between the parties by and to whom the publication is made is such that the person publishing the matter is under some legal, moral or social duty to publish it to the person to whom the publication is made or has a legitimate personal interest in so publishing it; (b) if the matter published is in fact a fair report of anything said, done or shown in a civil or criminal inquiry or proceeding before any court; except that if the court prohibits the publication of anything said or shown before it, on the ground that it is seditious, immoral or blasphemous, the publication thereof shall not be privileged; (c) if the matter published is a copy or reproduction, or in fact a fair abstract, of any matter which has been previously published, and the previous publication of which was or would have been privileged under section 183; (d) if the matter is an expression of opinion in good faith as to the conduct of a person in a judicial, official or other public capacity or as to his or her personal character so far as it appears in such conduct; (e) if the matter is an expression of opinion in good faith as to the conduct of a person in relation to any public question or matter, or as to his or her personal character so far as it appears in such conduct; (f) if the matter is an expression of opinion in good faith as to the conduct of any person as disclosed by evidence given in a public legal proceeding, whether civil or criminal, or as to the conduct of any person as a party, witness or otherwise in any such proceeding or as to the character of any person so far as it appears in any such conduct as mentioned in this paragraph; (g) if the matter is an expression of opinion in good faith as to the merits of any book, writing, painting, speech or other work, performance or act published or publicly done or made, or submitted by a person to the judgment of the public or as to the character of the person so far as it appears therein; (h) if the matter is a censure passed by a person in good faith on the conduct of another person in any matter in respect of which he or she has authority, by contract or otherwise, over the other person or on the character of the other person, so far as it appears in such conduct; (i) if the matter is a complaint or accusation made by a person in good faith against another person in respect of his or her conduct in any matter, or in respect of his or her character so far as it appears in such conduct, to any person having authority, by contract or otherwise, over that other person in respect of such conduct or matter, or having authority by law to inquire into or receive complaints respecting such conduct or matter; or (j) if the matter is published in good faith for the protection of the rights or interests of the person who publishes it or of the person to whom it is published, or of some person in whom the person to whom it is published is interested. 185. Good faith defined. A publication of defamatory matter shall not be deemed to have been made in good faith by a person, within the meaning of section 184, if it is made to appear either— (a) that the matter was untrue and that he or she did not believe it to be true; (b) that the matter was untrue and that he or she published it without having taken reasonable care to ascertain whether it was true or false; or (c) that in publishing the matter, he or she acted with intent to injure the person defamed in a substantially greater degree or substantially otherwise than was reasonably necessary for the interest of the public or for the protection of the private right or interest in respect of which he or she claims to be privileged. 186. Presumption as to good faith. If it is proved on behalf of the accused person that the defamatory matter was published under such circumstances that the publication would have been justified if made in good faith, the publication shall be presumed to have been made in good faith until the contrary is made to appear, either from the libel itself, or from the evidence given on behalf of the accused person or from evidence given on the part of the prosecution.Chapter16Chapter18",

(1) Defamatory matter is matter likely to injure the reputation of any person by exposing that person to hatred, contempt or ridicule, or likely to damage any person in his or her profession or trade by an injury to his or her reputation. (2) It is immaterial whether at the time of the publication of the defamatory matter the person concerning whom such matter is published is living or dead. (3) No prosecution for the publication of defamatory matter concerning a dead person shall be instituted without the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. 181. Definition of publication.",

(2) It is not necessary for libel that a defamatory meaning should be directly or completely expressed, and it suffices if such meaning and its application to the person alleged to be defamed can be collected either from the alleged libel itself or from any extrinsic circumstances or partly by the one and partly by the other means. 182.

      "content": "187. Manslaughter. (1) Any person who by an unlawful act or omission causes the death of another person commits the felony termed manslaughter. (2) An unlawful omission is an omission amounting to culpable negligence to discharge a duty tending to the preservation of life or health, whether such omission is or is not accompanied by an intention to cause death or bodily harm. 188. Murder. Any person who of malice aforethought causes the death of another person by an unlawful act or omission commits murder. 189. Punishment of murder. Any person convicted of murder shall be sentenced to death. 190. Punishment of manslaughter. Any person who commits the felony of manslaughter is liable to imprisonment for life. 191. Malice aforethought. Malice aforethought shall be deemed to be established by evidence providing either of the following circumstances— (a) an intention to cause the death of any person, whether such person is the person actually killed or not; or (b) knowledge that the act or omission causing death will probably cause the death of some person, whether such person is the person actually killed or not, although such knowledge is accompanied by indifference whether death is caused or not, or by a wish that it may not be caused. 192. Killing on provocation. When a person who unlawfully kills another under circumstances which, but for this section, would constitute murder, does the act which causes death in the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation as defined in section 193, and before there is time for his or her passion to cool, he or she commits manslaughter only. 193. Provocation defined. (1) “Provocation” means and includes, except as stated in subsections (3) to (5), any wrongful act or insult of such a nature as to be likely— (a) when done or offered to an ordinary person; or (b) when done or offered in the presence of an ordinary person to another person— (i) who is under his or her immediate care; or (ii) to whom he or she stands in a conjugal, parental, filial or fraternal relation, or in the relation of master and servant, to deprive him or her of the power of self-control and to induce him or her to commit an assault of the kind which the person charged committed upon the person by whom the act or insult is done or offered. (2) When such an act or insult is done or offered by one person— (a) to another; or (b) in the presence of another to a person— (i) who is under the immediate care of that other; or (ii) to whom that other stands in any such relation as aforesaid, the former is said to give to that other provocation for an assault. (3) A lawful act is not provocation to any person for an assault. (4) An act which a person does in consequence of incitement given by another person in order to induce him or her to do the act and thereby to furnish an excuse for committing an assault is not provocation to that other person for an assault. (5) An arrest which is unlawful is not necessarily provocation for an assault, but it may be evidence of provocation to a person who knows of the illegality. 194. Diminished responsibility. (1) Where a person is found guilty of the murder or of being a party to the murder of another, and the court is satisfied that he or she was suffering from such abnormality of mind, whether arising from a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind, or any inherent causes or induced by disease or injury, as substantially impaired his or her mental responsibility for his or her acts and omissions in doing or being a party to the murder, the court shall make a special finding to the effect that the accused was guilty of murder but with diminished responsibility. (2) On a charge of murder, it shall be for the defence to prove that the person charged was suffering from such abnormality of mind as is mentioned in subsection (1). (3) Where a special finding is made under subsection (1), the court shall not sentence the person convicted to death but shall order him or her to be detained in safe custody; and section 105 of the Trial on Indictments Act shall apply as if the order had been made under that section. (4) The fact that one party to a murder is by virtue of this section not liable to be sentenced to death shall not affect the question whether any other party to it shall be sentenced to death. 195. Suicide pacts. (1) It shall be manslaughter and shall not be murder for a person acting in pursuance of a suicide pact between him or her and another to kill the other or be a party to the other killing himself or herself or being killed by a third person. (2) Where it is shown that a person charged with the murder of another killed the other or was a party to the other’s killing himself or herself or being killed, it shall be for the defence to prove that the person charged was acting in pursuance of a suicide pact between him or her and the other. (3) For the purposes of this section, “suicide pact” means a common agreement between two or more persons having for its object the death of all of them, whether or not each is to take his or her own life, but nothing done by a person who enters into a suicide pact shall be treated as done by him or her in pursuance of the pact unless it is done while he or she has the settled intention of dying in pursuance of the pact. 196. Causing death defined. A person is deemed to have caused the death of another person although his or her act is not the immediate or sole cause of death in any of the following cases— (a) if he or she inflicts bodily injury on another person in consequence of which that person undergoes surgical or medical treatment which causes death. In this case it is immaterial whether the treatment was proper or mistaken, if it was employed in good faith and with common knowledge and skill; but the person inflicting the injury is not deemed to have caused the death if the treatment which was its immediate cause was not employed in good faith or was so employed without common knowledge or skill; (b) if he or she inflicts a bodily injury on another which would not have caused death if the injured person had submitted to proper surgical or medical treatment or had observed proper precautions as to his or her mode of living; (c) if by actual or threatened violence he or she causes such other person to perform an act which causes the death of such person, such act being a means of avoiding such violence which in the circumstances would appear natural to the person whose death is so caused; (d) if by any act or omission he or she hastened the death of a person suffering under any disease or injury which apart from such act or omission would have caused death; (e) if his or her act or omission would not have caused death unless it had been accompanied by an act or omission of the person killed or of other persons. 197. When child deemed a person. A child becomes a person capable of being killed when it has completely proceeded in a living state from the body of its mother, whether it has breathed or not, and whether it has an independent circulation or not, and whether the navel string is severed or not. 198. Limitation as to time of death. (1) A person is not deemed to have killed another if the death of that person does not take place within a year and a day of the cause of death. (2) Such period is reckoned inclusive of the day on which the last unlawful act contributing to the cause of death was done, and when the cause of death is an omission to observe or perform a duty, the period is reckoned inclusive of the day on which the omission ceased. (3) When the cause of death is in part an unlawful act and in part an omission to observe or perform a duty, the period is reckoned inclusive of the day on which the last unlawful act was done or the day on which the omission ceased, whichever is the laterChapter17Chapter19",

      "content": "253. Things capable of being stolen. (1) Every inanimate thing, which is the property of any person and which is movable, is capable of being stolen. (2) Every inanimate thing which is the property of any person and which is capable of being made movable is capable of being stolen as soon as it becomes movable, although it is made movable in order to steal it. (3) Every tame animal, whether tame by nature or wild by nature and tamed, which is the property of any person, is capable of being stolen. (4) Animals wild by nature, of a kind which is not ordinarily found in a condition of natural liberty in Uganda, which are the property of any person and which are usually kept in a state of confinement, are capable of being stolen, whether they are actually in confinement or have escaped from confinement. (5) Animals wild by nature, of a kind which is ordinarily found in a condition of natural liberty in Uganda, which are the property of any person, are capable of being stolen while they are in confinement and while they are being actually pursued after escaping from confinement, but not at any other time. (6) An animal wild by nature is deemed to be in a state of confinement so long as it is in a den, cage, sty, tank or other small enclosure, or is otherwise so placed that it cannot escape and that its owner can take possession of it at pleasure. (7) Wild animals in the enjoyment of their natural liberty are not capable of being stolen, but their dead bodies are capable of being stolen. (8) Everything produced by or forming part of the body of an animal capable of being stolen is capable of being stolen. 254. Definition of theft. (1) A person who fraudulently and without claim of right takes anything capable of being stolen, or fraudulently converts to the use of any person other than the general or special owner thereof anything capable of being stolen, is said to steal that thing. (2) A person who takes or converts anything capable of being stolen is deemed to do so fraudulently if he or she does so with any of the following intents— (a) an intent permanently to deprive the general or special owner of the thing of it; (b) an intent to use the thing as a pledge or security; (c) an intent to part with it on a condition as to its return which the person taking or converting it may be unable to perform; (d) an intent to deal with it in such a manner that it cannot be returned in the condition in which it was at the time of the taking or conversion; (e) in the case of money, an intent to use it at the will of the person who takes or converts it, although he or she may intend afterwards to repay the amount to the owner, and “special owner” includes any person who has any charge or lien upon the thing in question or any right arising from or dependent upon holding possession of the thing in question. (3) A person shall be taken to use money at his or her own will for the purposes of subsection (2)(e), if that person deliberately or recklessly exceeds the limits of authority allowed to him or her, or deliberately or recklessly disregards any rules of procedure, prescribed by the owner in respect of the money. (4) When a thing stolen is converted, it is immaterial— (a) whether it is taken for the purpose of conversion or whether it is at the time of the conversion in the possession of the person who converts it; (b) that the person who converts the thing in question is the holder of a power of attorney for the disposition of it, or is otherwise authorised to dispose of it. (5) When a thing converted has been lost by the owner and found by the person who converts it, the conversion is not deemed to be fraudulent if at the time of the conversion the person taking or converting the thing does not know who is the owner and believes on reasonable grounds that the owner cannot be discovered. (6) A person shall not be deemed to take a thing unless he or she moves the thing or causes it to move. (7) Without prejudice to the general effect of subsection (6), a person shall be taken to have moved money if that person moves or causes it to be moved from one account to another or otherwise out of the original account. 255. Special cases. (1) When a factor or agent pledges or gives a lien on any goods or document of title to goods entrusted to him or her for the purpose of sale or otherwise for any sum of money not greater than the amount due to him or her from his or her principal at the time of pledging or giving the lien, together with the amount of any bill of exchange or promissory note accepted or made by him or her for or on account of his or her principal, such dealing with the goods or document of title is not deemed to be theft. (2) When a servant, contrary to his or her master’s orders, takes from his or her possession any food in order that it may be given to an animal belonging to or in the possession of his or her master, that taking is not deemed to be theft. 256. Funds, etc. held under direction. When a person receives, either alone or jointly with another person, any money or valuable security or a power of attorney for the sale, mortgage, pledge or other disposition of any property, whether capable of being stolen or not, with a direction in either case that such money or any part thereof, or any other money received in exchange for it, or any part thereof, or the proceeds or any part of the proceeds of such security, or of such mortgage, pledge or other disposition, shall be applied to any purpose or paid to any person specified in the direction, such money and proceeds are deemed to be the property of the person from whom the money, security or power of attorney was received until the direction has been complied with. 257. Funds, etc. received by agents for sale. When a person receives, either alone or jointly with another person, any property from another on terms authorising or requiring him or her to sell it or otherwise dispose of it and requiring him or her to pay or account for the proceeds of the property or any part of such proceeds, or to deliver anything received in exchange for the property to the person from whom it is received, or some other person, then the proceeds of the property, and anything so received in exchange for it, are deemed to be the property of the person from whom the property was so received, until they have been disposed of in accordance with the terms on which the property was received, unless it is a part of those terms that the proceeds, if any, shall form an item in a debtor and creditor account between him or her and the person to whom he or she is to pay them or account for them, and that the relation of debtor and creditor only shall exist between them in respect thereof. 258. Money received for another. When a person receives, either alone or jointly with another person, any money on behalf of another, the money is deemed to be the property of the person on whose behalf it is received, unless the money is received on the terms that it shall form an item in a debtor and creditor account, and that the relation of debtor and creditor only shall exist between the parties in respect of it. 259. Theft by persons having an interest in the thing stolen. When any person takes or converts anything capable of being stolen, under such circumstances as would otherwise amount to theft, it is immaterial that he or she has a special property or interest in that thing, or that he or she is the owner of the thing taken or converted subject to some special property or interest of some other person in it, or that he or she is lessee of the thing, or that he or she is one of two or more joint owners of the thing, or that he or she is a director or officer of a corporation or company or society who are the owners of it. 260. Husband and wife. A person who, while a man and his wife are living together, procures either of them to deal with anything which is to his or her knowledge, the property of the other in a manner which would be theft if they were not married, is deemed to have stolen the thing and may be charged with theft.

In this division of this Code, “document” does not include a trademark or any other sign used in connection with articles of commerce though they may be written or printed. 344. Bank note and currency note. In this division of this Code, “bank note” and “currency note” include any notes, by whatever name called, which are legal tender in the country in which they are issued. 345. Making a false document. Any person makes a false document who— (a) makes a document purporting to be what in fact it is not; (b) alters a document without authority in such a manner that if the alteration had been authorised it would have altered the effect of the document; (c) introduces into a document without authority while it is being drawn up matter which if it had been authorised would have altered the effect of the document; (d) signs a document— (i) in the name of any person without his or her authority whether such name is or is not the same as that of the person signing; (ii) in the name of any fictitious person alleged to exist, whether the fictitious person is or is not alleged to be of the same name as the person signing; (iii) in the name represented as being the name of a different person from that of the person signing it and intended to be mistaken for the name of that person; (iv) in the name of a person personated by the person signing the document, if the effect of the instrument depends upon the identity between the person signing the document and the person whom he or she professes to be. 346. Intent to defraud. An intent to defraud is presumed to exist if it appears that at the time when the false document was made there was in existence a specific person, ascertained or unascertained, capable of being defrauded by it, and this presumption is not rebutted by proof that the offender took or intended to take measures to prevent such person from being defrauded in fact, nor by the fact that he or she had, or thought he or she had, a right to the thing to be obtained by the false documentChapter32Chapter34",
